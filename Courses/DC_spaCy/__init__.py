"""
Overview:
- Extract linguistic features: part-of-speech tags (POS), dependencies, named entities
- work with pre-trained statistical models
- find words and phrases using Matcher and PhraseMatcher match rules
- best practices for working with data structures Doc, Token, Span, Vocab, Lexeme
- find semantic similarities using word vectors
- write custom pipeline components with extension attributes
- scale up your spaCy pipelines and make them fast
- create training data for spaCy statistical models
- train and update spaCy's neural network models with new data

----------------- MORE THINGS TO D with scaCy
- Training and updating other pipeline components
    - Part-of-speech tagger
    - dependency parser
    - text classifiers
- Customizing the tokenizer
    - adding rules and exceptions to split text differently
- Adding or improving support for other languages
    - 45+ languages currently
    - lots of room for improvement and more languages
    - allows training models for other languages
